HOW MUCH IT RAINED ?
2 MEASUREMENTS WHICH ARE NEEDED TO BE COMPARED.
They are : Radar and Gauge measures.
More precise is Gauge due to less errors as compared to Radar.

DOPPLER VELOCITY: Varying velocity of the waves in the water…I guess, not sure.
-	there are two radars that observe the atmosphere above the rain gauge.
HYDRO-METEOR: PRECIPITATES, formed because of water vapour condensation.
DATA:
Train – 11,26,934                         Test- 6,30,521

More look into the Data Pattern:
TimeToEnd is given in random order which I assumed to be only in decreasing order.
DistanceToRadar varies sometimes for the same radar observation but varying time, which I assumed to be constant as seen most of the times.
